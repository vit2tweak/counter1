A React-based counter application with TypeScript support that allows users to increment, decrement, and reset a counter value with persistent storage.

## Architecture
- **Frontend**: React 18 with TypeScript
- **State Management**: Custom React hooks
- **Styling**: CSS modules
- **Storage**: Local storage for persistence
- **Build Tool**: Create React App with TypeScript template

## Key Features
- Increment/Decrement counter
- Reset functionality
- Persistent storage (survives page refresh)
- Type-safe implementation
- Responsive design
- Error handling for storage operations

## Component Structure
```
App
├── Counter (main counter component)
├── useCounter (custom hook for counter logic)
├── storage utilities (localStorage wrapper)
└── TypeScript types
```

## Development Notes
- Uses functional components with hooks
- Implements custom hook pattern for reusable logic
- Error boundaries for graceful error handling
- Follows React best practices and conventions
- Fully typed with TypeScript interfaces

## Future Enhancements
